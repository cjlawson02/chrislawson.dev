Selected projects demonstrating technical expertise and problem-solving capabilities across professional and academic environments.

### Professional Experience

#### Amazon

At Amazon, I work on digital marketplace payment systems that impact millions of vendors worldwide. As a Software Development Engineer I (Sep 2024 – Present), I design and implement scalable microservice architectures, focusing on high-availability payment reporting systems. Previously as a Jr. Software Developer (Dec 2021 – Jun 2024), I contributed to full-stack development using Java, Angular, and React, including creating an AWS Lambda solution for automated vendor invoice notifications.

#### GreenSight Tech

As Co-founder & Engineering Lead (Jan 2024 – Sep 2024), I architected an AI-driven multi-tenant ERP system specifically for electronics recyclers and resellers. I led the development of a data-driven platform for electronics identification and pricing, successfully delivering a production-ready beta to three businesses. Technologies included React.js, React Native, and Cloudflare, with significant AI/ML integration.

#### Cal Poly ITS

In my role as Service Desk Lead (Mar 2021 – Dec 2021), I managed campus-wide technical support operations, coordinating incident response through Slack, Confluence, and JIRA. Responsibilities included managing and interviewing student assistants while ensuring efficient service desk operations.

#### Wilson Creek Communications

As a Network Engineering Intern (Jul 2019 – Sep 2020), I maintained network infrastructure across 20+ sites and led a significant backend migration to VMware ESXi servers. I developed Python scripts for AP location mapping using Google Earth, optimizing network coverage planning and maintenance workflows.

#### LifeGuard CPR and Aquatics

During my time as webmaster for LifeGuard CPR and Aquatics (no longer in operation), I implemented a WordPress solution with integrated payment processing to streamline class registration and training management.

### FRC Team 973: The Greybots

My journey in robotics began with [Team 973 The Greybots](https://greybots.com), Atascadero High School's championship-winning robotics team. This experience ignited my passion for robotics and software engineering, teaching me invaluable lessons about teamwork, problem-solving under pressure, and how to make tough judgement calls when balancing code reliability and competitive edge.

During my third year of college, I returned to mentor the team, focusing on teaching high school students programming fundamentals and Java development. This role allowed me to develop my technical leadership skills while helping students understand the balance between rapid prototyping and competition-ready code reliability. By implementing fast iteration practices and emphasizing code quality, our team achieved a remarkable 4th place finish at the World Championships, demonstrating the impact of strong technical mentorship on team performance.

Key technical contributions from the full tenure include:

#### Greybots Signin

[Greybots Signin](https://github.com/Team973/greybots-signin): I developed a web application integrated with [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) for automated attendance tracking of 20+ students, significantly reducing manual record-keeping time. This was my first real-world experience with web development and API integration.

#### GreyDash

GreyDash: Engineered a real-time robot monitoring dashboard using [Smoothie Charts](http://smoothiecharts.org) for data visualization and [closed-loop PID system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) tuning. Tool adopted by multiple teams at competitions.

#### 2018 Robot Code

Our [2018 Robot: Havoc](https://github.com/Team973/2018-inseason) was a quarterfinalist at the Houston World Championship. I programmed the [Drive Subsystem](https://github.com/Team973/2018-inseason/blob/dev/src/subsystems/Drive.h) code that controls the drivetrain of the robot.

#### 2019 Robot Code

Our [2019 Robot: Fireball](https://github.com/Team973/2019-inseason) was the Houston World Championship Winner, as well as a two time winner of the Autonomous Programming Award. I programmed and tuned many parts of the robot, but mostly taught new programming students C++.

### Personal Projects

Self-directed technical implementations demonstrating system design and practical problem-solving capabilities.

#### Homelab

My homelab is my personal playground for experimenting with enterprise-level technologies.  My infrastructure includes multi-gigabit networking, home automation, Active Directory, and containerized applications. It serves as my testing environment for system architecture and network management.

#### Family NAS

I designed and deployed a 6TB [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) system using [TrueNAS](https://truenas.org) on custom hardware ([specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/G96XRk)) for reliable 24/7 family data backup.

#### Personal PC

I built my personal desktop for programming in addition to gaming. See the full [hardware specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mxDdFG).

#### ChickenDoor

I developed [automated coop door](https://github.com/Chris2fourlaw/ChickenDoor) system using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). I implemented embedded systems programming, I2C communication, and web interface for monitoring and control.
