I'm Chris Lawson, a Software Development Engineer at Amazon SLO focused on building innovative solutions with measurable impact. As a Cal Poly Computer Science graduate, I specialize in transforming complex challenges into efficient, elegant solutions.

My work spans from developing payment reporting systems at Amazon to building my own homelab and exploring photography. Here you'll find my journey through various projects, both professional and personal, along with insights into who I am beyond the code.
