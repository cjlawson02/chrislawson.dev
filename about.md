Hey there! I'm a second-year at Cal Poly SLO studying Computer Engineering.

## Hobbies and Interests

Besides computers, I love photography, mountain biking, and collecting records. I love to get outside to the coast and go on road trips and long drives!

## Projects

You can find all my current and past projects on my [projects page](/projects.html)! Feel free to ask me any questions about them!
