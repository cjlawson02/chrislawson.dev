## Professional Summary

Software Development Engineer at Amazon | Former Co-founder at GreenSight | Computer Science Graduate from Cal Poly, SLO | SysAdmin at CPARC (W6BHZ)

At Amazon, I develop a payment reporting and invoicing system that streamlines marketplace earnings management for thousands of global vendors on Prime Video, Amazon Music, Kindle Direct Publishing, Amazon Merch, and more. The system's rebrandable nature has measurably improved operational efficiency for Amazon's businesses worldwide.

My technical foundation began before pursuing Computer Science at Cal Poly. As SysAdmin for Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club (W6BHZ), I maintain critical infrastructure and implement system improvements, combining hands-on technical expertise with practical problem-solving.

The entrepreneurial spirit caught me during my time as co-founder of GreenSight Technologies through the Cal Poly Summer Accelerator program, I led development of an AI-powered ERP for electronics resale. Our solution helped resellers identify and price electronics more accurately, directly impacting their bottom line while reducing electronic waste.

## Beyond the Code

Outside of technology, you'll find me pursuing photography: capturing portraits, landscapes, and urban architecture. This creative outlet complements my technical work, developing an eye for detail and composition. I also enjoy bouldering and rock climbing, mountain biking on Central Coast trails, and collecting vinyl records!

I am also licensed HAM radio operator (General class) and proud alumni of the [Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club (W6BHZ)](https://www.w6bhz.org/), I actively contribute to advancing emergency communications infrastructure. I worked to deploy an Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN), an mesh networking system that provides high-speed data communications during disasters when traditional infrastructure fails. My work implementing and expanding the Central Coast AREDN network has strengthened regional emergency response capabilities. I love exploring the possibilities of wireless communication. Whether it's making contact with operators across the globe or helping with emergency communications during local events, it's a hobby that perfectly blends technical skills with community service.
