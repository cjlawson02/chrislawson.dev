Hey there! I'm a Jr. Softwre Developer at Amazon SLO and a second-year Computer Engineer at Cal Poly.

## Hobbies and Interests

Besides computers, I love photography, mountain biking, and collecting records. I love to get outside to the coast and go on road trips!

I also frequently use my HAM Radio License, and I'm a member of the [Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club (W6BHZ)](https://www.w6bhz.org/).

## Projects

You can find all my current and past projects on my [projects page](/projects.html)! Feel free to ask me any questions about them!
